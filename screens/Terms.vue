    <h3>B. USER CONTENT </h3>

    <p>
      The App allows you to submit text, text files and graphic files of
      particular formats available within the App (the “Input Content”)
      and generate new original content based on it using AI (the “Output
      Content”). For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “User
      Content” explicitly includes both Input and Output Content. WE DO
      NOT CLAIM ANY OWNERSHIP RIGHTS OVER YOUR USER CONTENT. YOU RETAIN
      ALL RIGHTS TO YOUR USER CONTENT AND MAY USE IT COMMERCIALLY. This
      means that you can do whatever you like with your Input and Output
      Content - to publish it, to incorporate it into other works, to
      print in any medium, to replicate, to distribute, to profit from the
      sale of copies of any products containing the Input and Output
      Content or to get benefit from the use of a digital version of the
      content.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that factual assertions in Output Content should not be relied
      upon without independently checking their accuracy, as they may be
      false, incomplete, misleading or not reflective of recent events or
      information.
    </p>

    <p>
      You acknowledge that Output Content may not be unique and other
      users may receive similar content from the App. Responses that are
      requested by and generated for other users are not considered your
      Output Content.
    </p>

    <p>
      You assume and bear all the risks related to your use of User
      Content. It is your sole responsibility to ensure compliance with
      the applicable laws while using User Content.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are responsible for all Input Content and represent and warrant
      that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions required to
      upload Input Content to the App. Before you upload your Input
      Content make sure that such content:
    </p>

    <p>
      - &nbsp;&nbsp; belongs to you or you have otherwise obtained the
      right to use it in the way that is technically allowed by the App;
    </p>

    <p>
      - &nbsp;&nbsp; is legally and socially acceptable and does not go
      against public order;
    </p>

      the copyright and the right to privacy.

    <p>
      Note that a set of prohibitions and restrictions apply with respect
      to both Input and Output Content.
    </p>

      Your compliance with the terms of Section VII is crucial. Your
      failure to comply with the terms of Section VII may result in
      termination of your access to the App and/or lead to other negative
      consequences.

      description of the dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.
